## Challenges & Afterthought

It was really hard to start this project from scratch...

I started with my Html & Css file before I work on my JS file, this way I get to know what variables that I need.

I found that really difficult to find the right order in JS... not sure what to do first then not sure what to do next.....lots of stuck moment.

Watched some videos about how other people think and why they think the next steps is needed it.
